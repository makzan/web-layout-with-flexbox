◊headline{About Pollen}

If you check the source code of this website, you may wonder why the HTML contains non-standard HTML tag. It’s because I compose this website by using the ◊link["http://pollenpub.com"]{Pollen}—A racket package that encourages writing books like a program. I’m still learning how to use Pollen and output valid HTML code.
