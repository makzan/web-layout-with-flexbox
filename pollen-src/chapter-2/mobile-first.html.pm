◊headline{Mobile first design}

Mobile first means that during our website planning, we plan the content and layout for the mobile first. Planning for mobile first ensures us to consider the most important thing of our website. The screen is so tiny that we have to think clearly what’s important enough to earn a place there. And what is the most important thing that we put it on top of this tiny screen.

In grid system, mobile first means we use the ◊code{small-*} layout modifiers by default. When we need to build a wider layout, we start using the ◊code{medium-*}, ◊code{large-*} and even ◊code{xlarge-*}. Each one overrides the smaller one.
