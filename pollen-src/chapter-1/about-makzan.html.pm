◊headline{About Makzan}

I am known as ◊em{Makzan} on internet.

I teach know-how via books, screencasts and face-to-face sharings.

I’m now in Macao to help transfering technology knowledge to Macao’s small-medium enterprise.

That’s why I’m currently working at CPTTM—Macau Productivity and Technology Transfer Center.
